    We will handle storage exception like this: user will get redirect to this html element. User will choose article name key will be article number. 
    He will also have a choice to select product name. After that user will submit form to upload files. For some reason, there is a unhandled exception 
    which corrupts our workflow. This will be like a fix for this.
